```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

I'm an R Markdown document!

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from a *normal distribution*:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too! The mean is `r round(mean(samp), 2)`.

# Section 3

This is going to make a plot! First I generate a dataframe, then use `ggplot` to make a scatterplot.

```{r chunk_scatterplot, echo = FALSE}

plot_df =
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(n = 1000),
    y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(n = 1000)
  )

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()

```

## Plot for Learning Assessment

This is a quick kind of solution to the LA

```{r}
la_df =
  tibble(
    norm = rnorm(n=500, mean = 1),
    logical = norm > 0,
    abs_norm = abs(norm)
  )

# ggplot(la_df, aes(x = , y = y)) + geom_histogram()
```
